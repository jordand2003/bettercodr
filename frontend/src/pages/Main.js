      <h3>Why BetterCodr?</h3>
      <p>
        On BetterCodr, code reviwers have an incentive to help others. Reviewing
        someone else's code can be a tedious and time consuming process, and for
        that reason many people don't have the extra time to help others out. On
        BetterCodr, code reviews gain an incentive for helping out their peers.
        For each review that user makes, that user will recieve 25 Codr coins!
